#### A simple microservices application with one service in Python (using Flask) and one service in Java (using Spring Boot). We'll use Docker Compose to deploy both services. Here's the step-by-step guide.


#### Architecture

The application will consist of two microservices:

Python Microservice: A simple Flask application that provides an API endpoint to return a greeting message.

Java Microservice: A Spring Boot application that provides an API endpoint to return a different greeting message.

Both services will be containerized using Docker and managed using Docker Compose.
